I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA in 2023. Subsequently, I joined as a Research Scientist in the Decentralized Systems Research group at [Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/about/researcher-profiles/avishek-1-banerjee/) in Murray Hill, NJ.

My research interest spans on wireless sensing, wireless communication and signal processing with the focus on developing innovative sensing and communication systems and physics-based machine learning models to improve wireless applications.


My research is driven by my curiosity to solve real-world problems with off-the-shelf systems. I work across signal processing, machine learning, hardware, and optimization to design and build intelligent systems for real-world applications. I made multiple inventions in the following domains

- <ins>Wireless Sensing</ins> [ **2 publications, 1 patent filed, 1 news article** ]
- <ins>Wireless Communication</ins> [ **2 publications, 1 Best Paper Runners Up** ]
- <ins>Physics-based Machine Learning</ins> [ **1 publication** ]
- <ins>Edge System for IoT</ins> [ **1 publication** ]
- <ins>Portable D2D Communication</ins> [ **Award** ]
