I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA in 2023. Subsequently, I joined as a Research Scientist in the Decentralized Systems Research group at [Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/about/researcher-profiles/avishek-1-banerjee/) in Murray Hill, NJ.

My research interest spans on wireless sensing, wireless communication and signal processing with the focus on developing innovative sensing and communication systems and physics-based machine learning models to improve wireless applications.


My research is driven by my curiosity to solve real-world problems with off-the-shelf systems. I work across signal processing, machine learning, hardware, and optimization to design and build intelligent systems for real-world applications. I made multiple inventions in the following domains

 **Wireless Sensing**
- Monitoring Microwave Oven Leakage to Estimate Food Temperature
- Monitoring Microwave Oven Leakage to Estimate Food Nutrients

 **Wireless Communication**
- Developing in-band Full Duplex Relay Cluster

 **Machine Learning**
- Cross-band wireless channel prediction

 **Edge Computing**
- POWWOW osuwireless overlay with Edge Computing and Core Computing support

 **Portable D2D Communication**
- PODNETS: An Android application for emergency messaging using multi-hop WiFi-Direct
